**loganal** creates a quick report for a chosen log file.

# Description
Example for syslog:
```
bash loganal.sh /var/log/syslog
```
or
```
chmod +x loganal.sh
./loganal.sh /var/log/syslog
```

When the analysis is done, a message with the report's path appears, it's saved in the current folder: 
```
Analysis complete. Report saved to '/home/johndoe/loganal/log_report_2025-01-01.txt'.
```
Then you can read it using cat:
```
cat log_report_2025-01-01.txt
```
The report looks like this:
```

## Requirements for the email feature (Optional)

Install Postfix and bsd-mailx
- `sudo apt install postfix bsd-mailx`
    - Choose *internet site*
    - Type a name

Enable and start Postfix
- `sudo systemctl enable postfix`
- `sudo systemctl start postfix`

Configure
- `sudo cp /etc/postfix/main.cf /etc/postfix/main.cf.old`
- `sudo vim /etc/postfix/main.cf`
     â†’ Replace `inet_interfaces=all` with `inet_interfaces=loopback-only`

Autorize Postfix to communicate
- `sudo ufw allow Postfix`
- `sudo ufw allow "Postfix SMTPS"`
- `sudo ufw allow "Postfix Submission"`

### Test the SMTP server
- `telnet localhost 25`, you should see something like `220 hostname.isp.domain ESMTP Postfix (Hostname)`

- `mailx address@email.com` and then enter the Subject, content, CC, and check if you received the email

When it works, just open the script with an editor and assign the email address to the variable `MAIL_RECIPIENT`. You'll receive the report generated by `loganal.sh` (Check the spam folder if you don't see it in your Inbox).
